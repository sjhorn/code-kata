# Solving Problems

The basic steps:

1. **Understand the problem**
   
   1. Articulate a inputs and output simulation
   
   2. State any assumptions
   
   3. Test/Validate assumption if possible

2. **Start with a simple example**
   
   1. Demonstrate a *methodical* approach to unpacking the problem/solution
   
   2. Demonstrate a *logical* thought process

3. **Explore the algorithms and data structures to solve the problem**
   
   1. This may require more examples to explore
   
   2. Think about things like pre-sorting vs. taking actions as iterating
   
   3. Consider if steps are being repeated or brute-forced unnecessarily
   
   4. Think measure twice, cut once - no need to jump into code too soon, unless trying to validate a thought-process

4. **Articulate your solution - playing it back may reveal gaps**
   
   1. Helps to double check your approach can be done eg. data structure can do that
   
   2. Validate the cost of each step.

5. **Check facts - either ask questions or verbalize**
   
   1. Playing back what you assume is factual - or even just ask the question out loud
   
   2. Be sure to check you have really solved the problem

6. **Trace through the solution and verify**
   
   1. Check the code works for at least 1 case, possibly the happy path
   
   2. Next explore other common cases

7. **Check for all kinds errors, special cases and boundary conditions**
   
   1. Try to think of all kinds of possible errors
   
   2. Consider -1, 0, 1, 2 and many cases
   
   3. Explore edges of the data structure, time and memory conditions
