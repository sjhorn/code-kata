Solving *problems* is not about diving immediately into a solution, but rather understanding the problem. In cases where it can be hard to <u>conceptualize</u> a problem - it is best to walk through a concrete sequence of steps or simulation. From the problem it can be helpful to solve that specific problem before moving to something more general. 

Once you are confident you have a general solution it can be valuable to write that down and then reason about ways to make it more efficient - trying to start with the biggest opportunities first. 

This repository will work through some examples of problems and demonstrate solutions in modern languages. To demonstrate the difference between options and refinements it will also visualize the results in terms of time and space.
