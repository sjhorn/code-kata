# Analyzing Solutions

After completing a solution it is valuable to explain the efficiency of an implementation. This will typically involve a few comparisons of alternatives and their trade-offs. For example:

* What are other possible ways to solve the problem - eg. loops, recursion, data structures
* What are the conditions that make one solution better than another 

A common way to compare and classify alternatives is comparing their _time complexity_ and _space complexity_. This is commonly referred to as **Big-O analysis** and looks at the run time and memory/disk usage.

> Big-O analysis measures the efficiency of an algorithm based on the time it takes to run relative to the input size. 

The key purpose of Big-O is to understand what happens when input get's really large, it is not as useful to analyzing efficiency when the input is small.
